This web map is suitable for cyclists and people who want to get closer to nature. I marked parks and bikeways in Vancouver. As you can see, almost every park is connected by several bike lanes (thanks to Vancouver's urban planning team!). Firstly, I gathered two data: park and bikeway from the city of Vancouver open data catalogue and converted to two layers into my web map. In order to make the map more readable and legible, I decided to start with "basic style" like Google Maps. When you zoom in to this style, you will see detailed street names, park names, and bike paths across. People can use this map to navigate to the nearest park or the right direction to continue riding. The overall goal for visual effect is “simple is the best” and clearness. I used green dots for parks and dark gray lines for bike lanes. This way, people can see each location clearly without messing up the main roads and bike lanes. I created a halo for each label of the park name because my web map has a lot of overlapping features. A light-yellow halo can make the label more eye-catching and increase the readability. Also, when people zoom in, the font size of the label increases. This is a crucial idea that I learned from The Guide to Map Design, Amy Lee Walton points out that “Readability is about arranging words in a way that allows the readers’ eye to access the content easily and intelligibly.”

I think there are still many areas for improvement on my map. First, I need to add some appropriate legends. The next step is that I should show the park as polygons instead of points, and for this I may need to use ArcMap. Third, maybe I can add a weather forecast to this map and design some ways to interact with it.

Critique of the map: I created a group chat with 472 three classmates to discuss some pop-up questions of lab and assignment. We have shared some useful tutorial links and videos to help each of us. We sent maps and gave each other feedback. Honestly, this is the best way to learn this course! I am completely a beginner to this type of coding and JavaScript. When I encountered some technical problems, they helped me a lot. I helped them with some cartographic issue each as the visual heritage of map and so on.
